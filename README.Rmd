# uncleShiny

### Frontend
`uncleShiny` is a dashboard for Unchained Labs Uncle data visualization. This app is written in R using the [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package.

Database access utilizes the [`RPostgres`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RPostgres/index.html) driver package and all data manipulations are heavily reliant on core packages from the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) including `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and `purrr.`

Visualization of data is mostly performed with Plotly and also `ggplot2.` Theming of this app was done using the [`bslib`](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/), [`thematic`](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/), and [`showtext`](https://github.com/yixuan/showtext) packages.

### Backend

[`unclePy`](https://github.com/eric-hunt/unclePy) is the parser which extracts meaningful experimental results and metadata from Uncle instrument binary files (.uni files), and delivers that data in a structured format to a local or remote hosted relational database built on PostgreSQL.
